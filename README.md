# 🧠 DSA-Questions

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** repository!  
This is a personal collection of solutions to common DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, CodeStudio, GeeksForGeeks, etc.

I’ve organized the problems **topic-wise**, so it’s easier to browse, refer, and update as I solve more.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a DSA topic. Inside each folder, you'll find `.cpp` files named after specific problems.

DSA-Questions/
├── binary_search/
├── recursion/
├── sorting/
├── patterns/
├── bit_manipulation/
├── two_pointers/
├── hashing/
└── ...more coming soon

## ✏️ Topics Covered So Far

- 🔍 Binary Search
- 🔁 Recursion
- 📊 Sorting Algorithms
- 🎨 Pattern Problems
- 🧠 Bit Manipulation
- 🧭 Two Pointers
- #️⃣ Hashing

> 💡 *More topics will be added as I continue learning and solving problems!*

## 🛠 Languages Used

- `C++` (mostly)

---

## ✅ How to Use

- Browse folders to find problems by topic
- Read the code comments for explanations (if added)
- Copy and run in your preferred IDE for practice

---

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Add README inside each topic folder with a list of problems
- Add problem links in comments
- Add time and space complexity for each solution
